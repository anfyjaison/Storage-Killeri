Project Description
A Windows app that maliciously installs itself repeatedly, fills your storage with junk files, and mocks you with sarcastic notifications. The digital equivalent of glitter bombing your own PC!

The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)

The Solution (Nobody Asked For)
We "fix" this by recursively installing our app while generating 1GB trash files per install, complete with sassy popups questioning your life choices.
